      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My idea is to create a mock web page for a fictional animation company. The purpose would be to create an online presence for the company where the target audience could see the animation companies' projects and potentially apply to work for the company. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience would be people that are interested in working for the company as well as other companies the animation studio wants to work with.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Anitech is an animation company dedicated to producing the highest quality animation style. We strive to make animations that captivate audiences, tell compelling stories, and inspire creativity. We make unforgettable stories through our dedication as we work together as a team from concept to the final project.

        We captivate audiences through beautiful animation and music. Our artists work from the very beginning of the concept, making concept art and storyboards. Our animators incorporate the art from our artists to make the animation as beautiful as it can be. We also use music to captivate our audience. Sound design is an important part of any movie or tv show. When we combine our animation with the right music and sounds we can draw the attention of any audience. 

        We tell compelling stories through animation. People love and remember compelling stories. Compelling stories can have a lasting impact on our society and culture. However, these days simple words alone do not attract as many people as a movie or a tv series does. We use our animation to tell stories that will have a lasting effect on our audience that they will remember.

        We inspire creativity through our animation and stories. We strive to show our creativity by portraying our animation using unique and interesting techniques. We create stories where creativity and imagination can run wild. We do this by creating worlds and stories that invite the viewer to think of all the creative possibilities.
