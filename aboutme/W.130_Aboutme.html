      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Josh Van Orden. I am from Blackfoot Idaho,
        but I currently live close to BYUI campus. I am one of five boys, I know, 
        my mom got lucky. When I am not working on online classes I am ether working
        out, hanging out with friends or working remotly for an animation studio.

        in computers and the amazing things they can do. I hope to learn how to program
